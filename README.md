### Project Objectives
    1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript.
    2. Output a random message consisting of at least three pieces of information.

### Project Description
The captain of Gitcombe Village Cricket Club 1st XI is Hugo Swigalot. He is the most lackadaisical captain in the history of the club, largely due to his gluttonous consumption of Bateman's Triple XB and Lamb's Navy Rum. However, the club boasts excellent playing facilities and the finest teas in all of the midlands, so is never short of willing and able players. Despite Gitcombe's squad of talented individuals they are frequently found languishing at the bottom of the league table because their captain is rarely compos mentis. So booze-addled is Hugo's mind that to the casual observer his capataincy decisions appear to be totally random.

This program aims to simulate his method of allocating roles to his players.

The random pieces of information will consist of:
- Batting order
- Fielding position
- Bowling type
- Recommended training

Possible extensions to the project could be: 
- Allow the user to input a team sheet and return objects with player names and roles.
- Add random players' comments about the captain and his decisions.
- Make into a web app with a graphical display of the fielding positions.

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Setup
To run this script, copy it locally and run using Node.js from your CLI.
```
$ node scriptExtended.js
```
There are two scripts, scriptBasic.js which fulfills the project requirements and scriptExtended.js which implements the extensions detailed at the end of the project description.

### Status
Project completed including the players' comment extension and the web app extension. To do is the user team input.

### Inspiration
My inspiration for this project is my love of the eccentric game of cricket.

    <p>
      The captain of Gitcombe Village Cricket Club 1st XI is Hugo Swigalot. He
      is the most lackadaisical captain in the history of the club, largely due
      to his gluttonous consumption of Bateman's Triple XB and Lamb's Navy Rum.
      However, the club boasts excellent playing facilities and the finest teas
      in all of the midlands, so is never short of willing and able players.
      Despite Gitcombe's squad of talented individuals they are frequently found
      languishing at the bottom of the league table because their captain is
      rarely compos mentis. So booze-addled is Hugo's mind that to the casual
      observer his capataincy decisions appear to be totally random.
